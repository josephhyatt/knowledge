# Design Philosophy

## The Don’t Repeat Yourself \(DRY\) principle

> The DRY principle is a concept used everywhere in software development. It encourages programmers to reduce repetition in their code base and isolate functionality in small, easier to maintain functions or files. This makes code modular, easier to understand, maintain and debug. Ruby on Rails has taken advantage of one of Ruby’s features, called metaprogramming, in an effort to keep its code DRY.

## Convention Over Configuration

> “Convention over configuration” is a practice utilized by frameworks where they set “sensible defaults” rather than allowing developers complete control, thus freeing programmers from having to make certain decisions, allowing them to concentrate on building the application.
