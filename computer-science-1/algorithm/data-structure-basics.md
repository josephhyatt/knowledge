# Data Structure Basics

## **Array**

**Definition:**

* Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.
* Based on [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) from set theory.
* They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structures.

**What you need to know:**

* Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting \(except at the end\).
* **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.
  * Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.
* **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.
  * If a dynamic array is full, it copies it's contents to a larger array.
* **Two dimensional arrays** have x and y indices like a grid or nested arrays.

**Big O efficiency:**

* Indexing: Linear array: O\(1\), Dynamic array: O\(1\)
* Search: Linear array: O\(n\), Dynamic array: O\(n\)
* Optimized Search: Linear array: O\(log n\), Dynamic array: O\(log n\)
* Insertion: Linear array: n/a Dynamic array: O\(n\)

## **Linked List**

**Definition:**

* Stores data with **nodes** that point to other nodes.
  * Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference \(another node\).
  * A linked list _chains_ nodes together by pointing one node's reference towards another node.

**What you need to know:**

* Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching.
* **Doubly linked list** has nodes that reference the previous node.
* **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose **tail**, the last node, references the **head**, the first node.
* **Stack**, commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.
  * Stacks are **last in, first out** \(LIFO\) data structures.
  * Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal.
* **Queues**, too can be implemented with a linked list or an array.
  * Queues are a **first in, first out** \(FIFO\) data structure.
  * Made with a doubly linked list that only removes from head and adds to tail.

**Big O efficiency:**

* Indexing: Linked Lists: O\(n\)
* Search: Linked Lists: O\(n\)
* Optimized Search: Linked Lists: O\(n\)
* Insertion: Linked Lists: O\(1\)

## **Hash Table or Hash Map**

**Definition:**

* Stores data with key value pairs.
* **Hash functions** accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key.
  * This is known as **hashing**, which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information.
  * Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data.

**What you need to know:**

* Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion.
* **Hash collisions** are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs.
  * All hash functions have this problem.
  * This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large.
* Hashes are important for associative arrays and database indexing.

**Big O efficiency:**

* Indexing: Hash Tables: O\(1\)
* Search: Hash Tables: O\(1\)
* Insertion: Hash Tables: O\(1\)

## **Binary Tree**

**Definition:**

* Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children.
  * There is one left and right child node.

**What you need to know:**

* Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
* A **degenerate tree** is an unbalanced tree, which if entirely one-sided is a essentially a linked list.
* They are comparably simple to implement than other data structures.
* Used to make **binary search trees**.
  * A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child is.
  * Left child has a key smaller than it's parent node.
  * Right child has a key greater than it's parent node.
  * There can be no duplicate node.
  * Because of the above it is more likely to be used as a data structure than a binary tree.

**Big O efficiency:**

* Indexing: Binary Search Tree: O\(log n\)
* Search: Binary Search Tree: O\(log n\)
* Insertion: Binary Search Tree: O\(log n\)
