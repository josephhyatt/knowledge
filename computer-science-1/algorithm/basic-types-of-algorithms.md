# Basic Types of Algorithms

## **Recursive Algorithms**

**Definition:**

* An algorithm that calls itself in its definition.
  * **Recursive case** a conditional statement that is used to trigger the recursion.
  * **Base case** a conditional statement that is used to break the recursion.

**What you need to know:**

* **Stack level too deep** and **stack overflow**.
  * If you've seen either of these from a recursive algorithm, you messed up.
  * It means that your base case was never triggered because it was faulty or the problem was so massive you ran out of RAM before reaching it.
  * Knowing whether or not you will reach a base case is integral to correctly using recursion.
  * Often used in Depth First Search

## **Iterative Algorithms**

**Definition:**

* An algorithm that is called repeatedly but for a finite number of times, each time being a single iteration.
  * Often used to move incrementally through a data set.

**What you need to know:**

* Generally you will see iteration as loops, for, while, and until statements.
* Think of iteration as moving one at a time through a set.
* Often used to move through an array.

**Recursion Vs. Iteration**

* The differences between recursion and iteration can be confusing to distinguish since both can be used to implement the other. But know that,
  * Recursion is, usually, more expressive and easier to implement.
  * Iteration uses less memory.
* **Functional languages** tend to use recursion. \(i.e. Haskell\)
* **Imperative languages** tend to use iteration. \(i.e. Ruby\)

## **Pseudo Code of Moving Through an Array \(this is why iteration is used for this\)**

```text
Recursion                         | Iteration
----------------------------------|----------------------------------
recursive method (array, n)       | iterative method (array)
  if array[n] is not nil          |   for n from 0 to size of array
    print array[n]                |     print(array[n])
    recursive method(array, n+1)  |
  else                            |
    exit loop                     |
```

## **Greedy Algorithm**

**Definition:**

* An algorithm that, while executing, selects only the information that meets a certain criteria.
* The general five components, taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm#Specifics):
  * A candidate set, from which a solution is created.
  * A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution.
  * A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution.
  * An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution.
  * A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution.

**What you need to know:**

* Used to find the optimal solution for a given problem.
* Generally used on sets of data where only a small proportion of the information evaluated meets the desired result.
* Often a greedy algorithm can help reduce the Big O of an algorithm.

**Pseudo Code of a Greedy Algorithm to Find Largest Difference of any Two Numbers in an Array.**

```text
greedy algorithm (array)
  var largest difference = 0
  var new difference = find next difference (array[n], array[n+1])
  largest difference = new difference if new difference is > largest difference
  repeat above two steps until all differences have been found
  return largest difference
```

This algorithm never needed to compare all the differences to one another, saving it an entire iteration.
