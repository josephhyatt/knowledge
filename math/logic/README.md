# Logic

## Notes

* [Semantics involves giving meaning to logical constants in a formal way. When we talk about truth table semantics, weâ€™re talking about a way to formally interpret \(or give meaning to\) sentences in the logical language using truth tables. Similarly, algebraic semantics does the same, but using algebras. Proof-theoretic semantics attempts to give meaning in terms of proof rather than truth conditions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/logic/comments/78rihs/why_call_it_semantics/)
