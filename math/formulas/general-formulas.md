# General Formulas

## Calculate Average

> **avg = total sum of all the numbers / number of items in the set**

* **Example 1:** You earned $129, $139, $155 and $176 over the last 4 weeks. What is your average pay?
  * **Step 1:** Add up all of the numbers in the set. **$129 + $139 + $155 + $176 = $599**
  * **Step 2:** Divide Step 1 by the total number of items in the set. There are 4 items in the set, so **$599 / 4 = $149.75**
