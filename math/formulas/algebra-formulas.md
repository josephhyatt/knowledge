## **Slope**

Slope is the measure of how a line changes. It’s expressed as: **The change along the y-axis / the change along the x-axis, or \rise/\run**

* * Given two points, $A\(x\_1,y\_1\)$, $B\(x\_2,y\_2\)$, find the slope of the line that connects them:

$$\(y\_2 - y\_1\)/\(x\_2 - x\_1\)$$

**Slope-Intercept Form**

* A linear equation is written as $y=mx+b$
  * _m_ is the slope and _b_ is the y-intercept \(the point of the line that crosses the y-axis\)
  * A line that passes through the origin \(y-axis at 0\), is written as $y=mx$
  * If you get an equation that is NOT written this way \(i.e. $mx−y=b$\), re-write it into $y=mx+b$

**Midpoint Formula**

* Given two points, $A\(x\_1,y\_1\)$, $B\(x\_2,y\_2\)$, find the midpoint of the line that connects them:

$$\(\(x\_1 + x\_2\)/2, \(y\_1 + y\_2\)/2\)$$

  
**Good to Know**

**Distance Formula**

* Find the distance between the two points

$$√{\(x\_2 - x\_1\)^2 + \(y\_2 - y\_1\)^2}$$

* **You don’t actually need this formula,** as you can simply graph your points and then create a right triangle from them. The distance will be the hypotenuse, which you can find via the pythagorean theorem

#### Logarithms

**There will usually only be one question on the test involving logarithms.** If you’re worried about having to memorize too many formulas, don’t worry about logs unless you’re trying for a perfect score.

$log\_bx$ asks “to what power does _b_ have to be raised to result in _x_?”

* Most of the time on the ACT, you’ll just need to know how to re-write logs

$$log\_bx=y =&gt; b^y=x$$

$$log\_bxy=log\_bx+log\_by$$

$$log\_b{x/y} = log\_bx - log\_by$$

### Statistics and Probability

#### Averages

The average is the same thing as the mean

* Find the average/mean of a set of terms \(numbers\)

$$\Mean = {\sum\of\the\terms}/{\the\number\(\amount\)\of\different\terms}$$

* Find the average speed

$$\Speed = {\total\distance}/{\total\time}$$
