# Introduction

> Hi there! My name is **Joseph Hyatt** and this is a list of everything I find useful to reference when the time is needed. Hope it helps you out as well.

## A little about me..

> My current skillset consists of `C++,` `JavaScript,` `Ruby/Rails,`and `Node.js`. As a web developer/programmer, I’m able to combine my love for creating, with my ability to find simple solutions to complex problems. All my life I have enjoyed recognizing the patterns that surround us on a daily basis. I believe in hard work and sharing what I know. I take challenges as inspiration while always looking for improvements.
>
> On my off time, I enjoy researching new technologies coming out to stay ahead of the learning curve.  When I get a case of “Coder’s Block” I ‘ll take my dog “Dooko” out for walks, go out to eat, drink coffee \(lot’s of coffee!\) and travel to new places.  That is one of the great benefits of coding, you can do it anywhere as long as the internet connection isn’t too weak.  I also like to get some gaming in while I can. Big PUBG fan \(on pc\), message me if you feel like putting your skills to the test
