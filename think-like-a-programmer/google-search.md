## Advanced Searches

> #### 1. Explicit Phrase
>
> Let's say you're searching on Google for content about [inbound marketing](https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing). Instead of just typing _inbound marketing_ into the Google search box, you will likely be better off searching explicitly for the phrase. To do this, simply enclose the search phrase within double quotes.
>
> **Example Search: "inbound marketing"**
>
> #### 2. Exclude Words
>
> Let's say you want to search for content about inbound marketing, but you want to exclude any results that contain the term _advertising_. To do this, simply use the - sign in front of the word you want to exclude.
>
> **Example Search: inbound marketing -advertising**
>
> #### 3. This OR That
>
> By default, when you conduct a search, Google will include all the terms specified in the search. If you're looking for any one of one or more terms to match, then you can use the OR operator. \(Note: The OR has to be capitalized\).
>
> **Example Search: inbound marketing OR advertising**
>
> #### 4. Words in the Text
>
> If you want to find a webpage where all the terms you're searching for appear in the text of that page \(but not necessarily beside each other\), type in _allintext:_ followed immediately by words or phrases.
>
> **Example Search: allintext:vermont ski house lake**
>
> #### 5. Words in the Text + Title, URL etc.
>
> If you want to find a webpage where one term appears in the text of that page and another term appears elsewhere on the page, like the title or URL, then type in that first term followed by _intext:_followed immediately by the other term.
>
> **Example Search: neil diamond intext:red sox**
>
> #### 6. Words in the Title
>
> Want to find a webpage with certain words contained in the title \(but not necessarily beside each other\)? Type in _allintitle:_ followed immediately by words or phrases.

> #### 9. How to Search Within a Website
>
> Often, you want to search a specific website for content that matches a certain phrase. Even if the site doesnâ€™t support a built-in search feature, you can use Google to search the site for your term. Simply use the _site:somesite.com_ modifier. \([Read this blog post to learn how to do this in more detail](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-google-site-search).\)
