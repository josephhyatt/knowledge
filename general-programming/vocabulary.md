## Programming Terms

> A List of Basic Programming Terms:

Here are the definitions for some basic programming terms, with usage examples. These terms are applicable to most programming languages.

I’ve tried to keep the definitions as simple as I can. This means that some definitions will be missing details and nuances, but they are correct in a general sense. For the practical purposes of a beginner programmer, the minor technicalities aren’t that important.

Where a term from this list is used in a definition, it will link to the term and look like this. Where a term can be used as both a noun and a verb \(e.g. assignment/assign\), I’ve only included a single definition – both usages should be deducible from the one definition.

## Algorithm

> A step-by-step procedure to achieve a specific goal. Can be implemented with code.

  
 `Example: I used the quick sort algorithm to sort the array alphabetically.`

## Argument

> A value that is passed into a function when it is called. Arguments are said to be “passed” into a function, and functions are said to “take” arguments. Also known as a “parameter.”

`Example: That function takes two arguments`

## Array

> A type of value that contains a sequence of other values.

`Example: I put all our names into an array of strings.`

## Assignment

> The act of putting a value into a variable.

`Example: I assigned the number 22 to the age variable.`

## Brackets

> Characters often used to surround text. The different types of brackets are:
>
> * Parenthesis/parens/round brackets: \( \)
> * Curly brackets/braces: { }
> * Angle brackets: &lt; &gt;
> * Square brackets: \[ \]
>
> The bracket at the beginning is called the “opening” or the “left” bracket. The bracket at the end is called the “closing” or “right” bracket.

`Example: Your` `code won’t compile because you forgot a closing bracket.`

## Bug

> A mistake in a program.

`Example: There must be a bug because the output is wrong.`

## Call

> To run the code in a function. Also referred to as “running,” “executing,” or “invoking” a function. For the noun, see function call.

`Example: I called the rand function and it returned 42.`

## Class

> A type that can be defined by the programmer. Classes are defined in order to create objects of that class.
