## Programming Terms

> A List of Basic Programming Terms:

Here are the definitions for some basic programming terms, with usage examples. These terms are applicable to most programming languages.

I’ve tried to keep the definitions as simple as I can. This means that some definitions will be missing details and nuances, but they are correct in a general sense. For the practical purposes of a beginner programmer, the minor technicalities aren’t that important.

Where a term from this list is used in a definition, it will link to the term and look like this. Where a term can be used as both a noun and a verb \(e.g. assignment/assign\), I’ve only included a single definition – both usages should be deducible from the one definition.

## Algorithm

> A step-by-step procedure to achieve a specific goal. Can be implemented with code.

  
 `Example: I used the quick sort algorithm to sort the array alphabetically.`

## Argument

> A value that is passed into a function when it is called. Arguments are said to be “passed” into a function, and functions are said to “take” arguments. Also known as a “parameter.”

`Example: That function takes two arguments`

## Array

> A type of value that contains a sequence of other values.

`Example: I put all our names into an array of strings.`

## Assignment

> The act of putting a value into a variable.

`Example: I assigned the number 22 to the age variable.`

## Bug

> A mistake in a program.

`Example: There must be a bug because the output is wrong.`

## Call

> To run the code in a function. Also referred to as “running,” “executing,” or “invoking” a function. For the noun, see function call.

`Example: I called the rand function and it returned 42.`

## Class

> A type that can be defined by the programmer. Classes are defined in order to create objects of that class.

## Compiler

> A program that converts code into an executable, and checks that the syntax is correct. Sometimes compilers convert code into other code.

`Example: The compiler is giving me an error, so I must have incorrect syntax somewhere.`

## Constant

> A variable that never changes its value.

`Example: The PI constant has the value 3.14.`

## Data Structure

> A value that contains other values.

`Example: Arrays are one kind of data structure.`

## Debug

> To investigate and fix bugs.

`Example: I spent all day debugging a complicated error.`

## Declaration

> Code that declares that something exists – usually a variable, function or a class. A declaration might not fully define the thing it is declaring. E.g. a constant may be declared to exist, without actually defining what it’s value is. Not all programming languages allow for declarations.

`Example: My code won’t compile because I wrote a function declaration, but I forgot to write the actual function.`

## Definition

> Code that fully implements something – usually a variable, function or a class. The code that implements a class is called the “class definition.” The code that implements a function is called the “function definition.”

`Example: The function wasn’t doing what I expected, so I had a look at its definition.`
